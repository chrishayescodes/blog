I'm glad you decided to browse my new blog. Sadly, this is just
getting started and a long way from anything significant. I'd like
to use this site to put content related to videos and streams I'm
planning on doing to augment them.

I've been told many times that my sweet spot is teaching. I've always
enjoyed sharing information with others and helping them solve 
problems. I hope you find this content useful.

My early plan is to discuss things I'm learning and trying to break
that down into smaller bite sized pieces. I want my content to be
linkable. If I speak about something, I want to have a link to other
content about that. So, depending on how deep you need to go, there
will be something there for you.

If you love coding as much as I do then you shouldn't have a problem
following what I'm talking about. I hope my presentations keep you
engaged so that you are able to consume the information and be
able to use it.

Try to always remember that you can't understand everything from the
beginning and I can't post something about everything from the 
beginning. If something doesn't make sense feel free to reach out
on twitter or email. I'll try my best to keep up with the feedback.
